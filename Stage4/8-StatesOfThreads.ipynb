    "In Java, the state of a thread is presented by the Thread.State enum with six possible values:\n",
    "* __NEW__: an instance of the class Thread has been created, but it has not yet started;\n",
    "* __RUNNABLE__: a thread is executing in JVM but it may be waiting for OS resources such a processor;\n",
    "* __BLOCKED__: a thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock (we will consider it later);\n",
    "* __WAITING__: a thread is waiting for another thread indefinitely long to perform a task (e.g. join without timeout);\n",
    "* __TIMED_WAITING__: a thread is waiting for another thread for a specified waiting time (e.g. sleep, join with timeout);\n",
    "* __TERMINATED__: a thread terminates when run method completely executes itself or an uncaught exception occurs. Once a thread terminates it never gets back to its runnable state."
